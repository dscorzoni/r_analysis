## Account Automation

Twitter has a pretty open API and this access to Twitter can be automated using many different softwares. Some of them are very popular and widely used by Social Media teams, but at the same time, someone can create a new programming to automate specific tasks. Many political actors have been using this kind of automation to spread content and inflate reach of hashtags, for example, artificially.

In this analysis we're going to use Twitter API data for a specific account to see signals of automation.
